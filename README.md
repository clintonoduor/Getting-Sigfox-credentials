# Getting-Sigfox-credentials

This simple arduino code helps you retreive Arduino MKRFOX 1200 board ID and PAC

 The PAC provided by the board is the factory value. It's a throw-away value and can only be used once, for initial registration. If you want to forward ownership of the board, you will need to contact the Sigfox support to get your up-to-date PAC.
