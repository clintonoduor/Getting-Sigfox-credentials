# Getting-Sigfox-credentials
Use this sketch to retrieve your Arduino MKRFOX board ID &amp; PAC, to register online in 3 minutes through the Sigfox DevKit onboarding platform.  This sketch does not send any message over the Sigfox network. It only retrieve identity information from the ATA8520 chipset.  ⚠️ The PAC provided by the board is the factory value. It's a throw-away value and can only be used once, for initial registration. If you want to forward ownership of the board, you will need to contact the Sigfox support to get your up-to-date PAC.
